# TicTacToe Robot

TicTacToe Robot is a cyber physical system that combines computer vision, game logic, and an **SO-101 robotic arm. A camera observes a physical 3×3 board, OpenCV detects the placed pieces, and the software checks the current game state**. During robot turns, the arm executes recorded joint trajectories to physically place a game piece **(X and O)** on the board.

The project also includes a standalone Pygame version called **Tic Tac Clash**, which allows the game interface and logic to be tested without the physical robot or camera.

The project transforms a simple TicTacToe game to allow software to  interact directly with the physical world. Instead of playing only on a screen, the system combines visual perception, board state recognition, game logic, and robotic movement.

The main goal is to demonstrate how a camera and robotic arm can work together in a closed interaction loop:

**Player move → Camera detection → Game state evaluation → Robot movement → Camera verification**

## Hardware

- SO-101 follower robotic arm
- Camera connected to the host computer
- Physical 3×3 TicTacToe board
- White `O` game pieces
- Black `X` game pieces
- Computer for vision processing and robot control

The current robot configuration uses the serial port `COM5` and the LeRobot follower ID `my_follower_arm`. These values can be changed in the Python scripts to match the local setup.

---

## Software

- Python 3
- OpenCV (`cv2`) for camera input, calibration, perspective transformation, image processing, and board detection
- NumPy for image and matrix operations
- LeRobot for SO 101 robotic arm communication and control
- Pygame for the standalone TicTacToe interface
- Python `csv` for robot trajectory files
- Python `threading` for non blocking robot execution during the live camera loop
- Python `json` for storing board calibration coordinates
- `msvcrt` for keyboard input in the Windows robot recording utility

---

## Dependencies & Setup

### Install Python dependencies

The project requires the Python packages used by the scripts:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python pygame
```

LeRobot must also be installed and configured separately so that the following imports are available:

```python
from lerobot.robots.so_follower import SO101Follower, SO101FollowerConfig
```

### Configure the SO-101 arm

The robot scripts currently use:

```python
FOLLOWER_PORT = "COM5"
FOLLOWER_ID = "my_follower_arm"
```

Update these values if the arm is connected through a different serial port or uses a different calibration ID.

The robot should already be calibrated before starting the game because the scripts connect using:

```python
robot.connect(calibrate=False)
```

### Connect the camera

The main game currently uses camera index `0`:

```python
CAMERA_INDEX = 0
```

If another camera is being used, change this value in `cps_maingame.py`.

### Calibrate the physical board

Before the first game, the program needs the position of the physical TicTacToe board.

1. Point the camera at the complete board.
2. Start calibration from the main menu.
3. Press `SPACE`, `ENTER`, or `C` to capture the camera frame.
4. Click the four corners in this exact order:
   - Top left
   - Top right
   - Bottom right
   - Bottom left
5. Press `Q` after all four points have been selected.
6. The coordinates are saved automatically to `board_corners.json`.

The calibration is then used to calculate a perspective transformation and generate a square 300 × 300 pixel board image for cell recognition.

### Prepare robot trajectories

Robot moves are stored as recorded joint position sequences. To create a new trajectory, run:

```bash
python cps_recordarm.py
```

The script disables motor torque so the arm can be moved manually. It then records the six joint values every `0.05` seconds and saves them as CSV data inside a `.txt` file.

To test a recorded trajectory independently, run:

```bash
python cps_moverobot.py
```

Enter the trajectory filename when prompted. The arm enables torque, executes the recorded positions at 20 Hz, disables torque, and disconnects when finished.

---

## Vision System

The live game first uses the four calibrated corners to transform the camera image into a top down square view of the board.

The transformed board is split into nine cells. To reduce interference from the grid lines, only the inner region of each cell is analyzed.

Each cell is converted from BGR to HSV color space and classified using color thresholds:

- A sufficiently large **white region** is classified as `O`.
- A sufficiently large **black region** is classified as `X`.
- If neither threshold is reached, the cell is classified as `empty`.

Morphological filtering and contour area checks are used to reduce small visual noise before a symbol is accepted.

---

## Game Logic

The game checks the eight standard TicTacToe winning combinations:

```text
Rows:      0-1-2   3-4-5   6-7-8
Columns:   0-3-6   1-4-7   2-5-8
Diagonals: 0-4-8   2-4-6
```

After each board check phase, the program returns one of three states:

- `WIN`
- `DRAW`
- `ONGOING`

When a winner is detected, the corresponding winning cells are highlighted in the visual interface.

---

## Physical Game Sequence

The current physical demonstration in `cps_maingame.py` uses a timed sequence of player turns, board checks, and prerecorded robot actions:

1. Player turn: 10 seconds
2. Check board: 3 seconds
3. Robot executes `cps_o_pos4.txt`: 20 seconds
4. Check board: 3 seconds
5. Player turn: 10 seconds
6. Check board: 3 seconds
7. Robot executes `cps_o_pos5.txt`: 20 seconds
8. Check board: 3 seconds
9. Player turn: 10 seconds
10. Final board check: 3 seconds

The robot trajectory runs in a separate thread so the camera feed and user interface remain responsive while the arm is moving.

---

## Running the Main Game

Start the physical version with:

```bash
python cps_maingame.py
```

The main menu provides three options:

- **START GAME**
- **RECALIBRATE BOARD**
- **EXIT**

### Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `S` | Skip the current timed step |
| `C` | Recalibrate the board during the game |
| `R` | Replay after the game has ended |
| `Q` | Return to the menu or exit the current screen |

---

## Offline Version

The project includes `cps_maingameoffline.py`, a standalone version of the game called **Tic Tac Clash**.

Run it with:

```bash
python cps_maingameoffline.py
```

The offline version includes:

- Player selection between `X` and `O`
- `X` always taking the first turn
- Adjustable turn duration from 1 to 30 seconds
- Mouse based player moves
- Random robot moves into available cells
- Robot thinking animation
- Win and draw detection
- Winning line visualization
- Replay and main menu options

This version is useful for testing the user interface and game state logic without connecting the robotic hardware.
